    // In this assessment, you will be evaluated on how well you organize your code into methods 
    // as well as how well you develop methods in order to achieve the requirements. 
    
    //Suggested Methods: 
    // Create a countCharacter() method
    // to count how many times a specific character appears in a string
    // Characters can be letters or punctuation
    // Hint: This can be done by taking in the character as a char or as a String
    // - vowels, punctuation
    //Hint: return an int


    //Create a method that counts the number of characters in a string

    //Create a method to count the number of words in a string

    //Create a method to find the longest word in a string

    //Create a method to find the shortest word in a string
